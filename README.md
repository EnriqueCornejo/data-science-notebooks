# Data Science Notebooks for Reproducible Science

Use this as a template for your data science computing notebooks. You need docker and docker-compose.

Just type `jupyter.sh develop` and you will be able to connect to `0.0.0.0:8888`. Also, a small microservice API will be running on `0.0.0.0:8889`, as defined in the `api_notebook.ipynb` notebook.

Some more examples will be added in time --like dataset access from the API.
